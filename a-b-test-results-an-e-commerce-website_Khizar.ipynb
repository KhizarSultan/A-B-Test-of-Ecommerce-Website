    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The work described in this notebook is based on a database providing details on the conversion rate of two groups(treatment group that holds the new page and control group that holds the old page), on an E-commerce platform from 2017-01-02 to 2017-01-24. The goal was to decide whether the E-commerce website should keep the old page or change to a new. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the quality of the data, we had only 1 row duplicated in a sample with 294,478 rows. So, that problem did not affect the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our goal, we performed the following tests: A/B test with z-test and logistic regression models. In A/B test, we found the p-value is higher than type error I, and because this, we fail to reject the null hyphotesis. Then, we saw the z-score was 1.31 which does not exceed the critical value of 1.96, so we fail again to reject the null hyphothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we used stasmodels to fit the regression model and we found there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives. In the first experiment with regression, we analyzed the individual factors of country and page on conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of our explanatory variables presented the following results: For each 1 unit decrease in new_page, conversion is 1.5 times as likely holding all else constant; For each 1 unit increase in CA, conversion is 4.1 times as likely holding all else constant; For each 1 unit increase in UK, conversion is 5.2 times as likely holding all else constant. In the last test we interpreted interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion, we discovered the following results: For each 1 unit increase in CA new_page, conversion is 8.1 times as likely holding all else constant. For each 1 unit increase in UK new_page, conversion is 4.8 times as likely holding all else constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I strongly recommend gathering more data per period of at least 4 months. I consider the period of 22 days insufficient for making the decision about whether we should keep the old page or change to the new page, even if all tests indicated that we should keep the old one. "
